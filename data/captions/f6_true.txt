Fig. 6
Integration of scRNA-seq and snMultiome data and correspondence of chromatin accessibility and gene expression across glutamatergic neuron types and ages during development.
a–d, UMAP representations
of scRNA-seq cells and snMultiome nuclei in the integrated space, coloured by subclass (a), data modality (b) and age in scRNA-seq (c) or snMultiome (d) datasets. The scRNA-seq cells shown in the UMAP are the subsampled ones (up to 200 cells per cluster) used for scVI integration. 
e,f, Heatmap representations of correspondence of chromatin accessibility and gene expression across IT subclasses (e) and nonIT subclasses (f) and ages during development. In each panel, each row corresponds to a peak–gene pair, ordered by peak module and peak–gene correlation, and each column corresponds to a subclass-by- age group. The left-hand and right-hand heatmaps show the average peak accessibility and average gene expression, respectively, in each subclass- by-age group. Accessibility and expression values are normalized, with a maximum value of 1 per peak or gene and 0 indicating no accessibility or expression.
