GRNs for IT and nonIT glutamatergic neuron types.
a,c, TF DNA-binding motif enrichment in chromatin accessibility peak modules with different cell-type and temporal specificities in IT subclasses (a) and nonIT subclasses (c). In each panel, the dot plot to the left shows the average motif frequency for each peak module (as shown in Fig. 6), dot size indicates the frequency and colour corresponds to the log odds of motif occurrence in each module relative to random chance. The large heatmap at the bottom shows the average accessibility for each peak module (in rows) across each subclass-by- age group (in columns). The heatmap at the top shows the average expression of specific TFs corresponding to the motifs across each subclass-by-age group. The values in the heatmaps are normalized per peak module or gene, with 1 indicating the maximum value and 0 indicating no accessibility or expression. 
b,d, GRNs for IT subclasses (b) and non-IT subclasses (d). Nodes represent genes, with triangles denoting TFs and circles denoting other genes. Each node is coloured according to the subclass in which the gene is most highly expressed. Activation interactions are in green, repression in orange, and edge widths reflect interaction strengths. 
e, Expression of shared cell-type TF regulators between IT and nonIT subclasses. 
f,g, GRNs involved in temporal regulation for IT subclasses (f) and nonIT subclasses (g). Each node is coloured by the age group in which each gene is most highly expressed. 
h, Expression of shared temporal TF regulators between IT and nonIT subclasses.
