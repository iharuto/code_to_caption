Fig. 4
Gene expression trajectories across cell types and ages during development.
a, Scaled expression of 31 non-constant gene trajectory groups, which are divided into up, transient up, transient down, and down categories. Faint lines represent individual DE genes, whereas the bold central line represents the average trajectory across all DE genes in the group. At each developmental age, the average trajectory was computed as the mean expression value of all genes assigned to the trajectory group. Bar graph to the right of each panel shows number of genes from each subclass that are included in the gene trajectory group. 
b, Representative gene expression trajectories for selected marker genes of pan-glutamatergic (Pan Glut), IT, nonIT, GABAergic or glial cell subclasses, which show higher and more sustained expression (with variable onsets) in the specific subclasses they represent than other subclasses. 
c, Cross-validation recall accuracy for each subclass at each postnatal age (P0–P56) using classifiers built based on all 1,035 adult marker genes (All markers), 71 TF marker genes (TF), 139 functional marker genes (Functional) and 183 marker genes encoding adhesion molecules (Adhesion). Subclasses with low recall accuracy scores at specific time points are labelled. For the box plots, the central line indicates the median value of accuracy, the box spans the interquartile range (IQR; 25th–75th percentile), and the whiskers extend to 1.5× the IQR, with outliers individually plotted. Labels are displayed for points with accuracy <0.8. The number of cells in each subclass at each age is shown in Supplementary Table 3.
