Developmental trajectories of visual cortex cell types.
a–h, Transcriptomic trajectory trees (a–d) and constellation plots (e–h) of glutamatergic (a,e), neuroglia (b,f), MGE (c,g) and CGE (d,h) clusters, which are grouped into subclasses. Each branch represents a cluster, for which the name is labelled in the same colour in the trajectory tree. In a, for glutamatergic clusters, the root is NECs and the tips are E12.5 terminal CR Glut cluster and 35 P56 terminal nonIT and IT cell clusters. In b, for neuroglia, the root is RG and the tips are 18 P56 terminal OPC-Oligo and Astro-TE clusters. In c, for MGE GABAergic neurons, the root is MGE GABA RG and the tips are 32 P56 terminal CTX-MGE and CNU-MGE clusters. In d, for CGE GABAergic neurons, the root is CGE GABA and the tips are 29 P56 terminal CTX-CGE clusters. Marker genes for each branch point are shown along each branch. Branch lengths represent pseudotime, measured from the origin of each trajectory. Each internal node represents a cluster composed of cells from one synchronized age bin and is coloured by that synchronized age bin. In the constellation trajectory plots, subclass names and P56 cluster identifiers are labelled.
