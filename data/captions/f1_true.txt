Transcriptomic developmental cell-type atlas of the mouse visual cortex.
a, Schematic timeline of samples collected from scRNA-seq and Multiome in this study along with major developmental events of the isocortex.
b, The transcriptomic taxonomy tree of 148 clusters organized in a dendrogram (scRNA-seq, n = 568,654 cells; Multiome, n = 200,061 nuclei). The classes and subclasses are marked on the taxonomy tree. Full cluster names are provided in Supplementary Table 3. Bar plots represent (top to bottom): major neurotransmitter (NT) type, number of scRNA-seq cells, number of Multiome nuclei, age distribution of scRNA-seq cells, age distribution of Multiome nuclei and number of scRNA-seq subclusters for each cluster. 
c–i, UMAP representations of all cell types coloured by class (c), subclass (d), cluster (e), subcluster (f), age (g), synchronized age (h) and pseudotime (i). 
j, Constellation plot showing the UMAP centroids of subcluster nodes coloured by cluster.
